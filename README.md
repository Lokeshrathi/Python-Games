# Python-Game - Hangman

### Rules:
- Play individually or in groups. 
- Have the student select a letter of the alphabet.
- If the letter is contained in the word/phrase, the individual takes another turn guessing a letter.  
- If the letter is not contained in the word/phrase, enter your next choice, a portion of the hangman is added. 
- The game continues until:
1. the word/phrase is guessed (all letters are revealed) – WINNER or,
2. all the parts of the hangman are displayed – LOSER

- The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. In most variants, proper nouns, such as names, places, and brands, are not allowed. Slang words, sometimes referred to as informal or shortened words, are also not allowed. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.

- I have added few words for Random choice, you many edit and choose your own words for the same.

## Happy Gaming and Coding!
